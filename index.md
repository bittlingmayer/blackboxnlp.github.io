# Analyzing and interpreting neural networks for NLP

*Revealing the content of the neural black box: workshop on the analysis and interpretation of neural networks for Natural Language Processing.*


## Description
Neural networks have rapidly become a central component in NLP systems in the last few years. The improvement in accuracy and performance brought by the introduction of neural networks has typically come at the cost of our understanding of the system: what are the representations and computations that the network learns? The goal of this workshop is to bring together people who are attempting to peek inside the neural network black box, taking inspiration from machine learning, psychology, linguistics and neuroscience. The topics of the workshop will include, but are not limited to:


- Applying analysis techniques from neuroscience to analyze high-dimensional vector representations (such as Haxby et al., 2001; Kriegeskorte, 2008) in artificial neural networks;
- Analyzing the network's response to strategically chosen inputs in order to infer the linguistic generalizations that the network has acquired (e.g., Linzen et al., 2016);
- Examining the performance of the network on simplified or formal languages;
- Proposing modifications to neural network architectures that can make them more interpretable (e.g., Palanki et al., 2017);
- Scaling up neural network analysis techniques developed in the connectionist literature in the 1990s (Elman, 1991);
- Testing whether interpretable information can be decoded from intermediate representations (e.g., Adi et al.,  2017; Chrupa≈Ça et al., 2017);
- Translating insights on neural networks interpretation from the vision domain (e.g., Zeiler \& Fergus, 2014) to language.

In addition to full papers, we will encourage the submission of non-archival extended abstracts; we thus foresee the reviewing load to be quite light: one full paper, or 2-3 abstracts, per program committee member.
